<h2 id="brief-overview">Brief Overview</h2>
<p>Our ETL pipeline starts when we pull commodity data from alphaVantage API - here we are pulling ALL data we can on the following commodities:</p>
<p>-Brent Oil
-Crude Oil
-Corn
-Cotton
-Wheat</p>
<p>In this program, we are looking to extract the correlations between any combinations of the commodities, so that statistically better predictions of one 
commodity could be made with information about a correlating commodity. Once we have this data, we format, melt, and export the dataframe with pandas into 
postgreql, which is then inserted into a localhost sql database which allows for us to pull data and correlations quicker than we could otherwise in python.</p>
<p>One serious bottleneck we have is that not all of the commodities were listed in the same year (or decade), so we are starting at the year 1990, when all of the five commodities were officially listed on publically traded exchanges held in alphaVantage's database. </p>
<p>We are more interested in the last five years of data, because though we are not macroeconomic experts, we think it would be fair to start from a time period where COVID affected many aspects of the stock market.</p>
<p>Another bottleneck in our ETL pipeline is the fact that we are only uploading it via .csv file with postgresql. If we were set on having this program be the fastest version of itself, we would likely use bulk insert statements, or directly taking data from the api into our server. We will likely get this working for the last part of our project. </p>
<p>For our DAG, we think that there could be a bottleneck in the way we have to pull five years of data each time we want to run statistical comparisons on prices, which we attempted to solve by using the {{ ref ('xxx') }} command in DBT.</p>
<h2 id="group-strengths-and-weaknesses">Group Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
<p>Our group broke up the project very evenly - however was not able to meet in person synchronously as much as we would have liked. Michael implemented the postgresql, and Jon and I (Tom) implemented DBT implementations and modules. I think if we were all more flexible on time (as this is the reason it was split by postgres/dbt), I think we would have all worked on each part together more comprehensively. On top of this, we ran into some troubles installing pgAdmin4, which resulted in Jon and I (Tom) using liveshare to work and submit our work. For the future parts of the project, we will likely carve out time in all of our schedules to work on this so that we can all have greater understanding of postgresql, dbt, and mkdocs. </p>
<p>As for strengths, I think that we all have a more thorough undrestanding of the individual topics we did cover (dbt, postgres) because of our need to implement them separately.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, and please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.</p>
